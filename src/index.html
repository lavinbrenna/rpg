          <h2>Rockerboy</h2>
          <p>Rebel rockers who use music and revolt to fight authority</p>
          <p>
            Rockerboys are the medieval bards of the dark future, the rebels,
            the punks and the musicians who use their voice to inspire the
            masses. Rockerboys are there to spread the anti-corporate message,
            to inform the downtrodden and weak and to lead groups into battle.
            The most famous Rockerboy to ever live is Johnny Silverhand; a
            soldier gone AWOL, he leads the band Samurai all the while
            plotting against the evil Arasaka corporation.

          <h2>Solo</h2>
          <p>Hired assassins, bodyguards, killers, soldiers</p>
          <p>
            Typically ex-military, almost certainly cyber-enhanced with more
            weaponry than a small army and ready to blow you away if somebody
            was paying. The Solo is your typical gun for hire character class,
            who thinks first, asks questions later and collects a paycheck for
            it. Morgan Blackhand, described as the Solo's Solo, is the most
            famous of these mercenaries.

        <div id="netrunner">
          <h2>Netrunner</h2>
          <p>Cybernetic computer hackers</p>
          <p>
            Fanatics of the workings of the Net. Rather than living in
            realspace where their abilities are limited by reality, Netrunners
            prefer to experience life through the means offered within the
            Net's artificial universe. With unique access to the Menu, they
            find themselves naturally savvy in sapping company networks and
            breaking into high-priority security systems for both a living and
            entertainment. These network trespasses are necessary to steal
            funds and information from networks. The data that is stolen is
            generally sold to a third party buyer, however this data does not
            come free, as the Netrunner must undergo the ultimate challenge of
            man versus machine in bypassing counter-intrusion programs that
            guard the techno-fortresses of the Net.

          <p>Renegade mechanics and doctors</p>
          <p>
            Techies typically have the highest tech stat of the group and play
            an important role making tech work for them.If you're any good,
            you're making a lot of money. And that money goes into new
            gadgets, hardware and information. You'll buy almost any new
            thing- because it might have a dozen side applications you can
            use. Of course, your black market work isn't just making you
            friends-it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies
            as well; people who've run into your handiwork and resented it. So
            you'll invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to
            the wall, call in a few markers on a Solo or two.

          <h2>Media</h2>
          <p>Newsmen and reporters who go to the wall for the truth</p>
          <p>
            They're bending the truth out there. And you're going to stop
            them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations rule the world. They
            dump toxins, destabilize economies and commit murder with equal
            impunity. The Government won't stop them-they own the Government.
            The only thing between the Corporations and world domination is
            the Media. And that's you.

        <div id="cop">
          <h2>Cop</h2>
          <p>Maximum lawmen on mean 21st century streets</p>
          <p>
            In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky
            if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled
            with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make an M-16 look
            like a kid's toy. If you're on a City Force, you know how bad it
            is. You're carrying at least four high caliber weapons, most of
            them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850
            ft/lbs per square inch- and you're still outgunned and outflanked.
            Half the gangs are cyber: super speed, super reflexes, enhanced
            night-vision, weapons in their arms ... The other half are
            freelance Corporate meres - gangs hired by the Corps to enforce
            their policies on the street. And there you are - a beat cop or
            detective in an armored squad-car, patrolling this jungle with the
            heavy predators.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="corpo">
          <h2>Corpo</h2>
          <p>Slick business raiders and multi-millionaires</p>
          <p>
            In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie - a hard
            driven, fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure,
            it's selling your soul to the Company, but face it; the
            Corporations rule the Cyberpunk world. They control governments,
            markets, nations, armies - you name it. And you know that whoever
            controls the Corporations controls everything else.Right now, your
            life as a junior executive is anything but easy. There are guys
            underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. There are guys
            over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. And they're not
            kidding about the killing - every up and comer in the Corporation
            has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his pet
            projects. Sabotage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Blackmail?
            Common. Promotion by assassination? Always a possibility. The
            stakes are that high - one slip and you could be out on the Street
            with the rest of the trash, or dead.

        <div id="fixer">
          <h2>Fixer</h2>
          <p>Deal makers, smugglers, organizers and information brokers</p>
          <p>
            You realized fast that you weren't ever going to get into a
            Corporate job. And you didn't think you were tough enough or crazy
            enough to be a Solo either. But as a small time punk, you knew you
            had a knack for figuring out what other people wanted, and how to
            get it for them. For a price, of course.Now your deals have moved
            past the nickle and-dime stuff into the big time. Maybe you move
            illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical
            supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're a skill broker
            acting as an agent for high priced Solos and 'Runners, or even
            hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's contracts. You buy
            and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather. You have
            connections into all kinds of businesses, deals and political
            groups. You don't do this directly, of course-no, you use your
            contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and
            coercion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've bought
            into it. If there are new military-class weapons on the Street,
            you smuggled 'em in. If there's a Corporate war going down, you're
            negotiating between sides with an eye on the main chance.

        <div id="nomad">
          <h2>Nomad</h2>
          <p>Road warriors and gypsies who roam the highways</p>
          <p>
            They drove your family off the Farm ten years ago. The
            Corporations rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-a cops
            all over the place. It wasn't the first time it'd happened; it
            wouldn't be the last. Gradually, your family fell in with a bunch
            of other homeless families, and they met another group ... until
            you'd created a Nomad pack of nearly two hundred members.Now,
            crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses and RV's,
            your Nomad pack roams the freeways. You look for supplies, odd
            jobs and spare parts in a world where society has fragmented. The
            pack is your home-it has teachers, Med Techs, leaders, and
            mechanics it's virtually a town on wheels in which everyone is
            related by marriage or kinship. Sometimes the Pack pulls into a
            town just to fuel up or get grub. Other times, it swings south to
            follow the harvest; you pick crops in trade for cash or food. Less
            law abiding Packs are like mobile armies, terrorizing cities and
            hiring out as muscle in Corporate wars. For obvious reasons, the
            cops don't like Nomads. But it doesn't matter-your vehicles are
            usually well armored and bristling with stolen weapons; mini guns,
            rocket launchers and the like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle,
            and everyone packs a knife. Being homeless in the 2000's isn't
            easy.
